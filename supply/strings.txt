# this is a header file for the strings analysis function
# it is kept in simple csv style; so it can easily edited
# the idea is to add strings possibly found in firmwares
# hints on what it is and a description
# 
# it is *not* made to repeat magic strings already existing in
# fudge database or libmagic/magic.mgc database
#
# needle: 
# all search strings(needle) are written in lower case; however FF will check 
# for lower and capital letters
# 
# shortdesc:
# add a short description
#
# tools:
# possible tools or url?
#
# format
