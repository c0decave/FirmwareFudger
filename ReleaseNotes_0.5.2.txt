Release Notes 0.5.2
===================

After quite some time, i decided to spend some dedication to this old tool i had written. There
lies over a decade between v0.3 and the current version 0.5.2.

Improvements:

*	FF has been ported to python3
* 	speed, 0.3 had a naive approach of parsing files, with a lot of extra requests,
	this had been changed, the speed improovements are over 300 times, so analysis of a firmware
	currently takes some seconds
*	bugs been fixed, one long term bug, was the always wrong suffix of a file type, this is
	normally no problem, however tools like gzip do not like it if .gz is missing, so i fixed
	the issue
*	code cleanups and refactory, had been done a lot, and there is still a lot to add
*	using argparse over getopt, as argparse is simply the better and more supportive alternative
*	there is an experimental method called strings, while the normal version is known to 
	everyone, this version also does an analysis to dig up some more information about the file
	more code and explanations will come
*	FF is now working with threads, which has some extra time improvements during analysis
*	FF is now using Queues at several stages
